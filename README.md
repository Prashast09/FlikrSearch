# FlikrSearch

Repository performs simple searching operation on **Flikr search API** to generate results with *infinite scrolling*.

##### Architecture (MVVM)

* **View** : Activity anf Fragments are responsible for all the view operations and navigations. 
They do not inherit any integlligence of underlying models. All we need to do is to supply data objects to be set in these views.

* **Repository** : They are the factory classes for all the data to be shown on UI. They handle all operations related to network calls/ DB queries/ Managers/ etc.

* **ViewModels** : Act as an interface and contain the buisness logic for the application. Any data generated by repository will be passed onto it's corresponding ViewModel which will further pipeline it to view.

* **LiveData** : They act as streams in which actual data flow. They are unidirectional in nature ( from ViewModel -> View )

#### Image Caching

* Since the application does not run a lot of process, preferred to use a Memory Cache rather than a Disk Cache.
* Created an LRU Cache of 1/8 the size of the memory cache. Can be increased based on requirement.
* LruCache of <Image Url, Bitmap>
* Everytime repo is requested to return the bitmap, it checks in LRUCache. If the bitmap is present then it returns else generates the bitmap and stores in cache for future use.


#### Unit Test Case
* Implemented test cases for returning number of page.
* On passing the query, viewmodel identifies which page number is the user is on.
